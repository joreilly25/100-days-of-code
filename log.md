# 100 Days Of Code - Log Started on [April 14th, Wednesday, 2021]

## Started with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum but am now following [Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation)

### Day 1: April 14th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished basic HTML/CSS on FCC

**Thoughts:** Getting back into codinng is a bit scary, but very fulfilling too, I'm excited to see where this takes me.

### Day 2: April 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Applied Visual Design, Applied Accessibility and Responsive Web Design Principles

**Thoughts**: Never realized how much goes into HTML it always seemed basic to me, but there is a lot it can do, and so many accessibility options, writing clean semantic HTML is not as easy as it may seem on the surface.

### Day 3: April 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid lesson sections also completed FCC Survey optional project

**Thoughts** Flexbox and Grid are amazing, but I have a lot to learn with it, I plan on watching some videos linked in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to get a better grip on them, as well as of course coding more using them.

### Day 4: April 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC Product landing page project

**Thoughts** Dabbled with Bootstrap, I have a lot to learn there. I was constantly back and forth with wanting to use vanilla CSS but then also using Bootstrap classes. Will most likely be using vanilla CSS only for my last FCC project. I also updated my portfolio page to link to my 100 Days of Code!

### Day 7: April 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript!!!!!!!!!!!

**Thoughts** Oh man, JavaScript has been an issue for me in the past, but I'm taking things slower this time to really understand it. I'm excited for what is to come.

### Day 8: April 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Took a little break from the courses this morning and I recoded my portfolio page. I wanted to utilize what I've learned to help cement it. Also wanted to not use any Frameworks (still used jQuery for the toTheTop button, just reused the code).

**Thoughts** Going into this I felt confident I could do it, and while I did, I did hit some walls. Flex and Grid are a lot to comprehend. I'm feeling confident in my learning overall.

### Day 9: April 22, 2021 - EARTH DAY!

**Today's Progress**: Back to The Odin Project! JavaScript fundamentals Part 2!

**Thoughts** Oh boy, JavaScript is something, there is a ton to it and it is quite intimidating, I'm trying to take it in decent size bites I feel this gives me time to wrap my head around concepts before moving further.

### Day 10: April 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript fundamentals Part 3!

**Thoughts** Functions are really awesome. I was telling my friend (amazing programmer btw) how I can see why people write their own functions and why frameworks exist. Being able to have a line of a code run a lot of things and having a place where you can go in and edit/fix if necessary seems very useful.

### Day 11: April 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Problem soliving with FizzBuzz!

**Thoughts** I really like how they break down problem solving. It has given me things to think about and I'm gonna make it a habbit of outlining the greater problem and breaking it down into smaller problems to first solve. While FizzBuzz wasn't a large problem to solve even still breaking it down it really stands out how helpful that is.

### Day 12: April 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors

**Thoughts** I had a good feeling going into this project, that I was prepared to tackle it. I outlined what needed to be done, and did ok at solving the problem at hand, however I wanted to go further with it, and found myself at a loss. I believe the issue is because I haven't fully learned how to use loops and more so how they interact with other loops, and if statements and such. Looking forward to learning more so that I can come back and add what I want to this project.

### Day 13: April 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Getting loopy with loops

**Thoughts** Loops are really kicking my butt, they seem so simple on the surface, but they are certainly in depth. I was a bit upset yesterday for not being able to properly implement a loop, but now that I'm actually learning about loops, I can totally udnerstand why yesterday was such a nightmare. I plan on taking this section quite slowly and going through some exercises to get a better handle on loops.

### Day 14: April 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: More practice with loops

**Thoughts** Taking it slower today, got another exercise done **_reverse string_**. Wife is sick so taking care of her, and running through little exercises on my phone will also be reading through some documentation later on loops.

### Day 15: April 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Even more practice with loops

**Thoughts** Two more exercises down! **_remove from array_** and **_sumAll_**. These projects seem simple at first, but when you start going down into the more difficult tests... They can have you stumped for a while! Glad that I'm making progress through these it can be frustrating when you can't quite figure it out, but once you do, its feels pretty amazing.

### Day 16: April 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Last 2 exercises of **Fundamentals Part 4**

**Thoughts** Final 2 exercises for Fundamentals Part 4 finished! **_leapYears_** and **_tempConversion_**. I felt these exercises to be a bit easier than the others, mainly because loops weren't involved. However they still taught me valuable lessons on what to look out for when writing if statement conditionals. I really liked the TDD (Test Driven Development) approach one day I need to learn to write tests for codes.

### Day 17: April 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started working with DOM manipulation!

**Thoughts** Started to work with using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM! I've been looking forward to working with the DOM. First exercises done, cant wait to get more into it. Tomorrow I'm working with events!

### Day 18: May 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Events!

**Thoughts** Wow events are complicated, but that's where all the magic happens! I'll be recoding the **[Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/joreilly25/rock-paper-scissors)** game from before using events and DOM manipulation to give it a GUI. Should be challenging but I'm sure I will learn a ton from it! Gonna take some time and read/watch more about events and DOM manipulation though for now.

### Day 19: May 4, 2021 - May the fourth be with you!

**Today's Progress**: Reworking **[Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/joreilly25/rock-paper-scissors)** to add click events.

**Thoughts** I managed to get click events working (still just console logs) for the game. Next up will be keeping track of score, and updating the DOM with this information.

### Day 20: May 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: More work on **[Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/joreilly25/rock-paper-scissors)** added score to the DOM, as well as fully playing rounds and displaying them on the DOM.

**Thoughts** Very happy with my progress thus far. I've had to slow down a bit becuase my wrists have been acting up, but I continue to read and learn about code on wrist rest days and I'm able to get right back into things when I get on.

### Day 21: May 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: More work on **[Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/joreilly25/rock-paper-scissors)** Added checkWinner function which alerts a winner after 5 games played.

**Thoughts** Felt nice to bring my laptop with me and code a bit while visitng family :)

### Day 22: May 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Currently working on the Google IT Automation course on coursera I felt I needed to switch gears from TOP based on how I seem to going professionally, given my history in the IT Support field I think this is a better fit to wrap my head around coding.

**Thoughts** The course hasn't gotten too much into actual coding just yet, so instead I started rewritng my JavaScript Rock Paper Scissors program in Python!

### Day 23: May 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Pushing through the Google course, and finished remaking my Rock Paper Scissors game in Python!

**Thoughts** Really like how I was able to take what I learned and apply it to Python, I know swapping between coding languages this early isn't ideal, but I'm glad I am right now.

### Day 24: May 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Another Module complete!

**Thoughts** I've completed the Week 2 module, the course moves fast, granted I'm moving faster than the course was technically intended, the course work has its jumps in difficulty for sure.

### Day 25: May 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Sadly today's progress was a bit lacking. I spent most of it setting up Wordpress, just to see if I could do it from scracth (installing the correct versions of PHP, MariaDB all via SSH) I did finally get it going!

**Thoughts** Felt pretty awesome to get it up and running all from command line. Mainly did it beause a lot of entry jobs in my area are seeking Wordpress knowledge or some sort of CMS.

### Day 26: May 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Been learning about APIs

**Thoughts** I've been getting a bit bored without building something, so I've started branching off the path and looking into APIs I wanna see if I can do something with it, maybe look into a front end framework as well.

### Day 27: May 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Moved focus to developing HTML emails

**Thoughts** Developing HTML emails is a great fit for my current skill set, I believe landing a position in this field, would be amazing to continue to develop my skills as a developer while also filling a company's need for someone with my skills.

### June 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Been handling some personal troubles that came up, as well as a ton of interviews!

**Thoughts** My grandma fell ill recently but she's doing better now, and I've been bombarded with interviews! Which is wonderful since I've been looking for work for some time now. Very excited with what the future holds!

### June 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Currently on hold, I've dived head first into the job search. Unfortunately I'm going to need to find work if I want to continue paying rent.

**Thoughts** I find some time between the stress of the job hunt to review past code, and talk about code with others, but currently a bit too worried about not finding work to really push forward with coding. Mostly looking for work with my tech support skills and with what I've learned as far as HTML/CSS/JS goes if anyone has any connections.

### June 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Went over some SQL things, unfortunately still haven't landed a job, but I'm optimistic!

**Thoughts** A lot of positions I've been lucky enough to interview for have questioned SQL knowledge, so I've been taking some time reviewing SQL. I've used it in the past, so its coming back to me rather well. Gonna be looking into JSON structure after this, I've always wanted to fully understand how that works.

### June 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Was researching some Django, potential job makes use of Django, so wanted to look into it.

**Thoughts** Very exciting opportunity that utilizes Django is in front of me, so getting to know it a bit better.
