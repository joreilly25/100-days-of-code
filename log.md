# 100 Days Of Code - Log Started on [April 14th, Wednesday, 2021]
## I am following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum

**Today's Progress**: Finished basic HTML/CSS on FCC

**Thoughts:** Getting back into codinng is a bit scary, but very fulfilling too, I'm excited to see where this takes me.

### Day 2: April 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Applied Visual Design, Applied Accessibility and Responsive Web Design Principles

**Thoughts**: Never realized how much goes into HTML it always seemed basic to me, but there is a lot it can do, and so many accessibility options, writing clean semantic HTML is not as easy as it may seem on the surface.

### Day 3: April 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid lesson sections also completed FCC Survey optional project 

**Thoughts** Flexbox and Grid are amazing, but I have a lot to learn with it, I plan on watching some videos linked in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to get a better grip on them, as well as of course coding more using them.

### Day 4: April 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC Product landing page project

**Thoughts** Dabbled with Bootstrap, I have a lot to learn there. I was constantly back and forth with wanting to use vanilla CSS but then also using Bootstrap classes. Will most likely be using vanilla CSS only for my last FCC project. I also updated my portfolio page to link to my 100 Days of Code!
