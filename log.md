### Day 2: April 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed Applied Visual Design, Applied Accessibility and Responsive Web Design Principles

**Thoughts**: Never realized how much goes into HTML it always seemed basic to me, but there is a lot it can do, and so many accessibility options, writing clean semantic HTML is not as easy as it may seem on the surface.

### Day 3: April 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid lesson sections also completed FCC Survey optional project 

**Thoughts** Flexbox and Grid are amazing, but I have a lot to learn with it, I plan on watching some videos linked in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to get a better grip on them, as well as of course coding more using them.

### Day 4: April 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC Product landing page project

**Thoughts** Dabbled with Bootstrap, I have a lot to learn there. I was constantly back and forth with wanting to use vanilla CSS but then also using Bootstrap classes. Will most likely be using vanilla CSS only for my last FCC project. I also updated my portfolio page to link to my 100 Days of Code!

### Day 7: April 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript!!!!!!!!!!!

**Thoughts** Oh man, JavaScript has been an issue for me in the past, but I'm taking things slower this time to really understand it. I'm excited for what is to come.

### Day 8: April 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Took a little break from the courses this morning and I recoded my portfolio page. I wanted to utilize what I've learned to help cement it. Also wanted to not use any Frameworks (still used jQuery for the toTheTop button, just reused the code).

**Thoughts** Going into this I felt confident I could do it, and while I did, I did hit some walls. Flex and Grid are a lot to comprehend. I'm feeling confident in my learning overall.

### Day 9: April 22, 2021 - EARTH DAY!

**Today's Progress**: Back to The Odin Project! JavaScript fundamentals Part 2!

**Thoughts** Oh boy, JavaScript is something, there is a ton to it and it is quite intimidating, I'm trying to take it in decent size bites I feel this gives me time to wrap my head around concepts before moving further.

### Day 10: April 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript fundamentals Part 3!

**Thoughts** Functions are really awesome. I was telling my friend (amazing programmer btw) how I can see why people write their own functions and why frameworks exist. Being able to have a line of a code run a lot of things and having a place where you can go in and edit/fix if necessary seems very useful.

### Day 11: April 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Problem soliving with FizzBuzz!

**Thoughts** I really like how they break down problem solving. It has given me things to think about and I'm gonna make it a habbit of outlining the greater problem and breaking it down into smaller problems to first solve. While FizzBuzz wasn't a large problem to solve even still breaking it down it really stands out how helpful that is.

### Day 12: April 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors

**Thoughts** I had a good feeling going into this project, that I was prepared to tackle it. I outlined what needed to be done, and did ok at solving the problem at hand, however I wanted to go further with it, and found myself at a loss. I believe the issue is because I haven't fully learned how to use loops and more so how they interact with other loops, and if statements and such. Looking forward to learning more so that I can come back and add what I want to this project.

### Day 13: April 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Getting loopy with loops

**Thoughts** Loops are really kicking my butt, they seem so simple on the surface, but they are certainly in depth. I was a bit upset yesterday for not being able to properly implement a loop, but now that I'm actually learning about loops, I can totally udnerstand why yesterday was such a nightmare. I plan on taking this section quite slowly and going through some exercises to get a better handle on loops.

### Day 14: April 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: More practice with loops

**Thoughts** Taking it slower today, got another exercise done *reverse string* Wife is sick so taking care of her, and running through little exercises on my phone will also be reading through some documentation later on loops.
